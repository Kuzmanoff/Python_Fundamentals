# Write a function that calculates the total price of an order and returns it. The function should receive one of the following products: "coffee", "coke", "water", or "snacks", and a quantity of the product. The prices for a single piece of each product are:

# 路 coffee - 1.50

# 路 water - 1.00

# 路 coke - 1.40

# 路 snacks - 2.00

# Print the result formatted to the second decimal place.
